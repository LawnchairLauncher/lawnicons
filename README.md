Lawnicons is an add-on for adding themed icons to [Lawnchair 12 Alpha 5](https://github.com/LawnchairLauncher/lawnchair) and above. This fork replaces the icons with their old pre-`1.0.0` filled variations.

> **ðŸ”§ Context**
>
> Some time before the first official release of Lawnicons, the then around 200 (mostly) filled icons were [replaced with redesigned outlined versions](https://github.com/LawnchairLauncher/lawnicons/commit/4c38e06ff5c373bf06d4f2daedebeace7c967d57).
> They matched each other much better, but personally I wasn't a big fan of the new design language.
> I decided to create this fork before the old version of Lawnicons I use right now stops working with Lawnchair.
> It's the current version of Lawnicons, but with the old filled icons.
>
> Lawnicons currently has about 1000 icons. This fork only contains the original 200.
> I don't plan on adding any new icons unless I need them for myself.
> However, PRs for doing so are welcome.
>
> The `legacy` branch contains the last official (pre-release) version of Lawnicons before the redesign
