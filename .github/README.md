**Lawnicons** is an icon pack developed by the Lawnchair team.
Originally an addon for Lawnchair 12 Alpha 5 and above to implement themed icons, it can now be used on many launchers. Some launchers may also support Lawnicons for themed icons.

Lawnicons is best used on Lawnchair 12.1. You can enable themed icons on Lawnchair by going to `Home Settings > General > Icon Style > Themed Icons`, choosing "Home Screen" or "Home Screen and App Drawer".

This project is mostly supported by our community. If you wish to contribute, see the [Contributing section](README.md#Contributing) below.
