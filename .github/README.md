**Lawnicons** is an icon pack developed by the Lawnchair team.
Originally an addon for Lawnchair 12 Alpha 5 and above to implement themed icons, it can now be used on many launchers. Some launchers may also support Lawnicons for themed icons.

Lawnicons is best used on [Lawnchair 12.1](https://github.com/LawnchairLauncher/lawnchair). You can enable themed icons on Lawnchair by going to `Home Settings > General > Icon Style > Themed Icons`, choosing "Home Screen" or "Home Screen and App Drawer".

This project is mostly supported by our community. If you wish to contribute, check out the Contributing section below.
