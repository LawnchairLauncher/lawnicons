<!-- Title example: "+1 icon, +2 links, +3 icon updates".
     +1 icon = +1 brand new icon (related links aren't considered).
     +2 links = +2 missing app components for existing icons.
     +3 icon updates = redesign of 3 existing icons.
     In other cases, choose something else to avoid confusion.
     Don't use "+ 1 icon" because the "+ " will be parsed as an indent. -->
