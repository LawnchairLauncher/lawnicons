## Contributor's checklist
<!-- Replace [ ] with [x] to check. -->
- [ ] I made the icons following [the Lawnicons Guidelines](https://github.com/LawnchairLauncher/lawnicons/blob/develop/CONTRIBUTING.md) (upd. Jan 2024) and will make changes if someone suggests. I will also make sure that Lawnicons builds correctly.
