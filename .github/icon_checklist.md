Hey! Thanks for the contribution. While there is no reviewer, you can do a self-review. This will help to fix the reasons why the icons may not be suitable for Lawnicons. 

### Canvas and sizes [→](https://github.com/LawnchairLauncher/lawnicons/blob/develop/CONTRIBUTING.md#canvas--sizes)
1. Canvas: `192×192px`.
2. Non-square icons: the long side of the icons should be `160px`.
3. Square icons: `154×154px`.

### Color, stroke width and rounding [→](https://github.com/LawnchairLauncher/lawnicons/blob/develop/CONTRIBUTING.md#foundation)
1. Color: black `#000`.
2. No fill. Base stroke width: `12px`. `14px`, `10px`, `8px` — depending on the shape of the icons. `6px` — for fine details.
3. Rounded ends and joins. 90° corners are rounded by `6-32px`.

### Naming [→](https://github.com/LawnchairLauncher/lawnicons/blob/develop/CONTRIBUTING.md#naming)
1. Names should match the official ones and contain no additional text.
2. If the original name is not in English, then add a localized (or transliterated) one to it using `~~`.
Example: `フールー ~~ Hulu`.
3. The names of the drawables should repeat the names of the apps if nothing prevents it.

### Quality [→](https://github.com/LawnchairLauncher/lawnicons/blob/develop/CONTRIBUTING.md#details)
1. Icons should be easily recognizable.
2. Align icons to [the visual center](https://www.google.com/search?sca_esv=1fcec3f5e0b15e20&q=what+is+visual+center+of+an+icon&tbm=isch&source=lnms).
3. No blackness. Reduce the stroke width or simplify the icons so that there are no noticeable black spots.
4. Avoid close distances between strokes. The icons on the phone screen will be smaller, so the small distances between the strokes will stick together.
5. Avoid drastic changes in stroke widths. When the strokes next to each other differ in width by 4px or more, the icon will look sloppy.
