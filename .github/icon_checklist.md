Please fix all common issues and ensure Lawnicons builds correctly. Reviews happen 1—2 times a month, occasionally more.

#### Review stages
1. **Viability check**. For beginners. This reduces effort spent on abandoned PRs.
2. **Review**. The review batch size ranges from 5 to 10 icons, depending on the number of common issues found.
