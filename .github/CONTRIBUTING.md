# Lawnicons contributing guide
Welcome to the Lawnicons contributing guide! This file will tell you what you need to know to contribute to Lawnicons.

Before you start, please [fork](https://github.com/LawnchairLauncher/lawnicons/fork) the project and clone it to your machine. 

Afterwards, you can either contribute icons or code.

## Contributing icons
To contribute icons, you only need an icon editor, a file explorer, a text editor, and a terminal window.

### Icon guidelines
See the below image for a summary of the icon guidelines. If you don't follow them, a team member will likely request changing the icons.

![](images/contributing-image-1.png)

Each icon must fit the 160x160px or 144x144px (depending on the shape) content area size. It must not be smaller nor bigger than the specified sizes.

The default stroke should be kept at 12px. For finer detail, a stroke of 6px can be used. The standard widths are 6px, 8px, 10px, 12px and 14px.

In addition to the above, the icons must have an outlined (not filled) style, joins and start/end points must be rounded and the colour must be black `#000000`. If the original icon has a filled style, change the icon to adhere to the guidelines as seen below.

For additional information on designing icons, see [the Lawnicons Figma repository](https://www.figma.com/community/file/1227718471680779613) made by [Grabstertv](https://github.com/Grabstertv).

### Adding an icon to Lawnicons
Here's how to add an icon to Lawnicons:

#### Prerequesties
* Your icon in the SVG format, adhering to the [above guidelines](#icon-guidelines). The filename must use snake case (e.g. `files_by_google.svg`).
* The package and activity name of the app.

#### Via `icontool.py`
Please check the [icon tool guide](/.github/icontool_guide.md) for more information.

#### Via manual process
1. Add the ready SVG to the `svgs` directory.

1. Add a new line to `app/assets/appfilter.xml` (in alphabetical order, by the `name` attribute), and map the new icon to a package name and app's activity. For example:

    ```xml
      <item component="ComponentInfo{com.google.android.apps.nbu.files/com.google.android.apps.nbu.files.home.HomeActivity}" drawable="files_by_google" name="Files by Google"/> 
    ```

    A general template is as follows:

    ```xml
    <item component="ComponentInfo{[PACKAGE_NAME]/[APP_ACIVITY_NAME]}" drawable="[DRAWABLE NAME]" name="[APP NAME]"/> 
    ```

1. Done! You're ready to open a pull request. Please set `develop` as the base branch.

### Finding the package and activity name of an app
#### Using `adb`
1. Connect your Android device or emulator to your laptop/desktop PC that has `adb` installed (see [this tutorial](https://www.xda-developers.com/install-adb-windows-macos-linux/) for more information) and open the app whose details you want to inspect, e.g. Telegram.
1. Open a new Command Prompt or Terminal window and input `adb devices`.
1. Finally, type the below-given command to get the information about the currently open application.

  **For Mac or Linux**:

  ```console
  adb shell dumpsys window | grep 'mCurrentFocus'  
  ```

  **For Windows**:

  ```console
  adb shell dumpsys window | find "mCurrentFocus"
  ```

  The part before the `/` character in the above image, i.e. `org.telegram.messenger`, is the package name (`[PACKAGE_NAME]`). The part after it, i.e. `org.telegram.messenger.DefaultIcon`, is the activity name (`[APP_ACIVITY_NAME]`).

#### Using 3rd-party apps
##### IconRequest app
1. Download the [IconRequest app](https://github.com/Kaiserdragon2/IconRequest/releases). 
2. Launch the app and click "REQUEST NEW" or "UPDATE EXISTING".
3. Get the Activity details for each app.

##### Icon Pusher app
1. Download the [Icon Pusher app](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=dev.southpaw.iconpusher&hl=en&gl=US).
2. Launch the app.
3. Select the icon(s) you want to upload or select all by pressing the square in the top right. Then press "Send".
4. View the Activity details for each app on the [Icon Pusher website](https://iconpusher.com/). Please make sure the `drawable="[DRAWABLE NAME]"` matches the icon SVG file name.

## Contributing code
While adding icons is the main focus for most contributors, code-related contributions are welcome.

Before building the app, ensure that you create the icon drawables by running:

```console
./gradlew svg-processor:run
```

Afterwards, you can build the app by selecting the `appDebug` build variant.

Here are a few contribution tips:
- [The `app` module](https://github.com/LawnchairLauncher/lawnicons/tree/develop/app) contains most of Lawnicons' core code, while [the `svg-processor` module](https://github.com/LawnchairLauncher/lawnicons/tree/develop/svg-processor) contains the code that converts the SVGs inside the `svgs` folder into Android Drawables. Generally, the `app` module is where you should make most of your contributions.

- You can use either Java or, preferably, Kotlin.

- Make sure your code is logical and well formatted. If using Kotlin, see ["Coding conventions"](https://kotlinlang.org/docs/coding-conventions.html) in the Kotlin documentation.

- Set `develop` as the base branch for pull requests.

- Significant changes to the UI should be discussed on our [Lawnchair's Telegram group chat](https://t.me/lawnchairci). Generally, we want to keep things clean and simple.
